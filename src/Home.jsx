I really hope i did well.. in tis project i used react router to facilitate page scrolling and all... i think i should work on a bigger project next... may God help me.. amen.. to test it out click on the <strong>Home</strong>, <strong>Login</strong> and <strong>Sign up</strong> links above.. this is the home page so you will not see much of a difference if you click the home route on the home page... I also implemented a 404 page... in the browser try to look for another route and you will be redirected to the 404 page... happy coding</p>
